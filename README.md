# blueSecure

BlueSecure is a really shitty obfuscator that i made while learning VM based obfuscation

I may continue updating it if I am bored, and also since it is so shitty, it can not obfuscate any print instructions and only 1 line of code which is a instruction like in script.lua

Anyways i may fix these errors in the future
